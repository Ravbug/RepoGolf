## RepoGolf

This is a little experiment I wrote to compare the codebase sizes of some large open source projects. 
You can view a webpage with charts here: [https://www.ravbug.com/repogolf](https://www.ravbug.com/repogolf)

### How to use
1. Download the repository
2. Run `repogolf.py`, it will print the list of available repositories
3. See `output.json` for the data
